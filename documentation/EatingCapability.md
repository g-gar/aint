# Eating

## Abstract

Living beings need to consume other living beings in order to stay alive.

## Foraging strategies [1]

There are a variety of strategies they can make use in order to achieve food/drinks, being:

* Actively look for food and probably hunt (requires time and energy to achieve)
  * Fish
  * Vegetables
  * Animals
  * Drinks
* Scavenge
* Steal

Drink foraging could be placed as the latter two strategies.

### Optimal Foraging Theory (best strategy for finding a meal)

To maximize the amount of energy an animal gets from it's prey, it needs to pursue food nutritious enough to make up for the time and energy spent catching and consuming the meal, which can be expressed as:

$$
R = \frac{E}{h} + s
$$

Being $E$ the potential energy gained, $h$ the required time to process the meal to consume and $s$ the search time.
